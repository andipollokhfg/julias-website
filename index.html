            <h3 class="highlight"> Preamble </h3>
            Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the
equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is
the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world, Whereas
disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous
acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent
of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and
belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the
highest aspiration of the common people, Whereas it is essential,
if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort,
to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights
should be protected by the rule of law, Whereas it is essential to
promote the development of friendly relations between nations,
Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter
reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity
and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and
women and have determined to promote social progress and better
standards of life in larger freedom, Whereas Member States have
pledged themselves to achieve, in cooperation with the United
Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of

 human rights and fundamental freedoms, Whereas a common
understanding of these rights and freedoms is of the greatest
importance for the full realization of this pledge, Now,
therefore, The General Assembly, Proclaims this Universal
Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement
for all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual
and every organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly in
mind, shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect
for these rights and freedoms and by progressive measures,
national and international, to secure their universal and
effective recognition and observance, both among the peoples of
Member States themselves and among the peoples of territories
under their jurisdiction.
